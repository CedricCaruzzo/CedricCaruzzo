Hey, Iâ€™m CÃ©dric ðŸ‘‹ â€” currently building **foundation models** and **multimodal systems** at [**Lunit**](https://lunit.io/) to help rewire how we diagnose and treat cancer.  
My day-to-day is a mix of deep computer vision, large-scale training, and occasionally convincing GPUs to behave.  

---

### ðŸ§  What I Work On
- **Foundation Models for Oncology** â€” training large-scale vision models on **digital histopathology** to find new biomarkers and improve diagnosis.
- **Multimodal AI for Cancer Research** â€” integrating histopathology with other modalities (the fun ones are still under wraps ðŸ¤«) for a full-spectrum view of cancer.
- **Computer Vision at Scale** â€” from microscopes to gigapixel slides, making sense of the tiny details that matter.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Mission
To make AI thatâ€™s robust, interpretable, and useful enough to *actually* change clinical practice â€” starting with cancer.  
If it needs to reason across images, text, chemistry, and biology, Iâ€™m probably interested.

### ðŸš€ Some Things Iâ€™ve Built
| Project | What Itâ€™s About |
| ------- | --------------- |
| **Foundation Model for Cell Painting** | Large-scale vision model learning rich, generalizable features from cell morphology images. |
| **Multimodal Phenotypeâ€“Compound Translation** | Bidirectional model translating between cell painting phenotypes and compound SMILES. |
| **Educatif PanNuke Segmentation** | Educational CV project on semantic segmentation, implementing U-Net & U-Net++ from scratch in PyTorch. |
| **Neural Style Transfer** | Reimplementation of the classic algorithm â€” because sometimes you *do* just want Van Gogh to paint your cat. |

### ðŸ“¬ Reach Me
Best place to find me is on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-caruzzo/).  
Iâ€™m always up for geeking out about vision, foundation models, multimodal learning, or why reinforcement learning agents would make terrible roommates.
