I'm an AI Research Scientist at [**Lunit**](https://lunit.io/), where my work is focused on building and applying large-scale AI models to solve complex scientific problems.

My core interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and biology, particularly in developing foundation and multimodal models that can interpret and translate complex data types. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with agentic AI and reinforcement learning.

### üî≠ My Mission: Foundation Models to Conquer Cancer

As part of the **AI Foundation team** at Lunit, I apply my research interests toward this core mission. We are creating robust and generalizable AI to fundamentally change how cancer is diagnosed and treated. Here's how my interests align with this goal:

* üß† **Foundation Models for Oncology:** My primary focus is architecting and training large-scale models on **digital histopathology** data to discover novel biomarkers and improve diagnostic accuracy.

* üß¨ **Multimodal Modeling for Cancer Research:** I work on creating systems that will integrate data from **histopathology, (and more to come ...ü§´)** for a truly holistic understanding of cancer.

* ü§ñ **Agentic AI & RL in Oncology:** I'm exploring how reinforcement learning can create intelligent agents for complex research and analysis tasks within the cancer domain.

* üëÅÔ∏è **Computer Vision:** I apply cutting-edge vision techniques to new frontiers in medical imaging and computational pathology.
